    "\n",
    "The people counter application is one of a series of IoT reference implementations aimed at instructing users on how to develop a working solution for a particular problem. It demonstrates how to create a smart video IoT solution using Intel® hardware and software tools. This solution detects people in a designated area, providing the number of people in the frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of how it works\n",
    "At start-up the sample application reads the equivalent of command line arguments and loads a network and image from the video input to the Inference Engine (IE) plugin. A job is submitted to an edge compute node with a hardware accelerator such as Intel® HD Graphics GPU, Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Stick 2 and Intel® Arria® 10 FPGA.\n",
    "After the inference is completed, the output videos are appropriately stored in the /results/[device] directory, which can then be viewed within the Jupyter Notebook instance.\n",

    "## Demonstration objectives\n",
    "* Video as input is supported using **OpenCV**\n",
